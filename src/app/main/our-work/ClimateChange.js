                semi-urban, to urban areas to champion actions in eco-mobility
                and sustainable transportation, climate education, afforestation
                and reforestation, waste management, climate smart agriculture,
                renewable energy, Blue economy and Ocean conservation etc. In
                addition to this, the manual suggests practical step-by-step
                activities that will deliver the climate goals across these

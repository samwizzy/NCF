              <p className='text-base'>
                The conservation of wildlife species and their habitats occupies
                a central position in the work of NCF. This focus on species is
                influenced by several factors.
              </p>
              <p className='text-base'>
                First, is the fact that species face serious conservation
                challenges. Further, the degradation of their habitats and
                sometimes the larger ecosystem which they occupy has continued
                unabated. Since species play varied roles in ecosystem
                maintenance and habitat management, their conservation is
                regarded as crucial for general ecosystem processes. Secondly,
                some of the species are of local, national and/or global
                significance given their status of being endangered, endemic and
                /or range restricted in nature. International treaties such as
                the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species
                (CITES) and the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) support
                the conservation and /or sustainable use of species.
              </p>
              <p className='text-base'>
                Thirdly, the fact that they form part of the natural web of life
                that supports human populations for their aesthetic values,
                usefulness in scientific research and medicine, human
                consumption for food in specific cases, and the need for their
                conservation for future generation of people is crucial to NCF.
              </p>
              <p className='text-base'>
                In general terms, NCF supports the conservation of all varieties
                of species of plants and animals. NCF also promotes species
                conservation through research, policy advocacy, public education
                and awareness. In recent times and based on her new strategic
                focus, NCF is determined to place priority on certain species of
                wildlife while we continue to support the conservation of others
                in general terms. Our past and current work focuses on the
                following species.

                We carried out field assessment of the populations of Gorilla on
                the rugged terrains of Afi- Mbe -Okwangwo in Boki Local
                Government area of Cross River State as far back as 1986. The
                Cross River lowland Gorilla (Gorilla gorilla dielhi) had lived
                in the south eastern part of Nigeria for many years. It is so
                called because of the slight difference between it and that of
                the western lowland gorilla. By the 1980s however it was
                believed that this primate had become extinct. This however
                changed with the NCF rediscovery and confirmation of the
                presence of this rare species in the area during that field
                assessment and subsequent surveys. This confirmation became a
                watershed and the basis for long term conservation activity by
                NCF, and other organisations, as well as global recognition of
                the prominence of the forests of Cross River State for their
                high conservation value. Since this pioneering work, NCF has
                established a Zonal Office in Cross River and has ongoing

                In all ramifications, NCF has done much to support the
                conservation of the most intelligent wild mammal. Apart from
                supporting the conservation of chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes
                vellerosus) in its range habitats and ecosystems in different
                parts of Nigeria and at different levels (Okomu National Park,
                Gashaka-Gumti National Park, Cross River National Park, Mbe
                Mountains in Cross River State, Afi Forests Reserve in Cross
                River State, Omo Forests in Ogun State), NCF has also
                collaborated with partners such as FFI, WWF and WCS at various
                times and on specific issues regarding the conservation and
                protection of chimpanzee populations in Nigeria.

              <p className='text-base'>
                The discovery of Pan troglodytes vellerosus as a distinct sub
                species only known to exist in the forests of Nigeria made the
                need for its conservation a more urgent and immediate cause. NCF
                has worked in all the areas important for the conservation of
                this sub-species (Afi, Mbe and Okwango in Cross River,
                Gashaka-Gumti and south-west Nigeria) but currently focuses on
                the fragmented forests of south-west Nigeria (particularly Omo

                In the mid-1980s, NCF organised an international fundraising
                campaign for the protection of the populations of Elephants in
                Yankari Game Reserve in the Nigerian savannah region. The
                campaign was launched in London and became so popular that it
                earned NCF great respect abroad and back home in Nigeria. In an
                effort to consolidate the gains of the campaign, a group of
                interested Nigerians together with their British friends
                registered a conservation Initiative known as the Yankari
                Initiative (later became Savanna Conservation Nigeria). This
                group has been supported by NCF and continued to work towards
                the conservation of elephants in Yankari.

                NCF did not stop with the Bush Elephants. It took interest in
                protecting the forest elephant (Loxodonta africana cyclotis) in
                south-west Nigeria. The forest elephant is now recognized as a
                distinct sub-species of elephants which makes it critically
                endangered and highlights the need for urgent action towards its
                conservation. NCF manages the Omo Forest Reserve under a
                Memorandum of Understanding with the Ogun State Government. The
                reserve harbours a population of forest elephants.

                If what had happened to the formerly rich forests of Edo State

                For about fourteen years that followed, NCF directly led the

                As the Partner of BirdLife International in the country, NCF
                inventoried the Important Bird Areas (IBAs) in Nigeria and
                published the findings in its book, “Critical Sites for
                Biodiversity Conservation in Nigeria”. The study found that
                Nigeria has 904 species of birds. These include 436 confirmed
                breeding residents, 165 residents that are suspected to breed,
                about 150 palearctic migrants and 90 intra African migrants. The

                conservation with 28 that met the IBA criteria. These IBAs are
                regularly monitored and the results are posted in the World

                With general persecution and faith-based practices responsible
                for the rapid depletion of the vulture to the point of being
                threatened, our role focuses on campaign and advocacy in order
                to correct misconception, stop belief-based use by traditional
                healers and help the recovery of vultures from the brink of
                extinction. We are working with BirdLife International, US Fish
                & Wildlife Service (USFWS), European Union, State governments
                and prominent individuals to promote conservation education,
                community governance, build institutional capacity and encourage
                the enforcement of appropriate laws and sanctions.

                With six out of the seven known species of the sea turtle
                threatened with extinction, we are committed to preserving these
                harmless animals through advocacy and preservation of the
                breeding sites of the sea turtles which is along the sandy
                shores. Our advocacy activities focus on awareness creation,
                grassroots mobilization and clean-up exercises in the coastal
                communities. We equally engage in rescue and release of turtles
                accidentally captured by fishers.

              Plants – Allanblackia

                The importance of the fruit of Allanblackia (Allanblackia
                fluribunda) as a Non-Timber Forest Product (NTFP) that is of
                immense economic value was recently discovered when a
                multinational company, Unilever, started using it to produce
                margarine in Nigeria. NCF played a prominent role in the
                assessment of the distribution and relative abundance of the
                plants in about twelve states in southern, central and
                north-eastern Nigeria. In the communities where the plant was
                found in abundance, NCF mobilised local people to protect
                forests for the commercial value that NTFPs such as Allanblackia
                provide to them.
